<p>
In Go 1.21, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/slices">slices</a> package got added to the Go standard library.
It provides functions for working with slices of any type. For example, the generic <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/slices@go1.21.0#Sort">
<code>slices.Sort</code></a> function is a generic sort  implementation that accepts any slice as long as the 
slice elements can be ordered. Its type constraint <code>cmp.Ordered</code> demands that the slice element type
supports the operators <code>&lt; &lt;= &gt;= &gt;</code>. Currently, such types are numbers (ints and floats),
pointers and strings. For other types, the slices package provides the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/slices@go1.21.0#SortFunc"><code>SortFunc</code></a>
function which also sorts the elements but takes an explicit comparison function as second argument. So far, this
seems like a classic example for standard library functionality.
</p>

<p>        
However, the Go standard library, since version 1.0, also contains the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sort">sort</a>
package. As its name indicates, it provides functions for sorting slices. Its interface, however, differs from the
slices package since Go did not support generics back then. Before Go 1.21, most people used functions like <code>sort.Slice</code>
or <code>sort.Strings</code> to sort items. Only recently, people have started using the newer slices package. Since the
Go standard library now provides two packages for sorting, one might wonder which one to choose. According to
the <code>sort.Strings</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sort@go1.21.0#Strings">documentation</a>: 
</p>

<pre><code>// Strings sorts a slice of strings in increasing order.
//
// Note: consider using the newer slices.Sort function,
// which runs faster.
func Strings(x []string)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="1", class="section"><a href="#1">How Sorting Works in Go</a></h3>

<p>
Both, the sort and slices package, use the same <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05123">pattern-defeating quicksort</a> (pdqsort)
implementation. They differ only slightly in how values are compared and paritioned. On a high level:
</p>

<pre><code>pdqsort:
   1. If data is small, use <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/slices/zsortordered.go;l=74-77">insertion sort</a>. Return.
   2. If there are no good pivot elements, fallback to <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/slices/zsortordered.go;l=80-83">heap sort</a>. Return.
   3. <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/slices/zsortordered.go;l=91-117">Pick</a> a pivot element and partition the slice.
   4. Call pdqsort for the <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/slices/zsortordered.go;l=121-124">left</a> and <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/slices/zsortordered.go;l=125-128">right</a> partition.
</code></pre>

<p>
It is basically textbook quicksort with some extra functionality. Textbook quicksort may require <code>O(n<sup><code>2</code></sup>)</code>
operations in certain cases while pattern-defeating quicksort falls back to a <code>O(N * log(N))</code> sorting algorithm when it runs into
such a worst case.
</p>
<p>
Even though both packages use basically the same quicksort implementation, a <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/yYRp0syHj3u">benchmark</a>
sorting 10k integers shows a significant performance difference:
</p>

<pre><code>goos: darwin
goarch: arm64
pkg: github.com/aead/bench
BenchmarkSlicesSort_Int-8           6771            176058 ns/op
BenchmarkSort_Ints-8                2109            585427 ns/op
PASS
ok      github.com/aead/bench   3.829s
</code></pre>

<p>
Profiling the benchmark reveals that the partition and insertion steps in the sort package are noticably slower.
The slices package uses direct assignments when swapping elements and the compiler is able to optimize the
<code>cmp.Less</code> calls for comparing two numbers into a single instruction while the sort package is tied
to the <code>Less</code> and <code>Swap</code> methods of the <code><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/sort@go1.21.0#Interface">sort.Interface</a></code> type.
When replacing the call to <code>slices.Sort</code> with <code>slices.SortFunc</code> and a custom comparison
function <code>func(a, b int) int { return a - b })</code> the performance difference becomes much smaller.
</p>

<p>
The compiler is able to optimize the generic <code>slices.Sort</code> much better since it has more information
about the types. In particular, it knows how to compare two numbers. For the <code>sort.Ints</code>, the compiler
could, in theory, figure out that the given <code>sort.Interface</code> is an <code>[]int</code>, inline the method
calls and apply the same optimizations. It just doesn't do that. However, inlining is a trade-off and the compiler
will not be able to infer the concrete type behind a <code>sort.Interface</code> in many cases. 
</p>

<h3 id="2", class="section"><a href="#2">Strings <code>!=</code> Numbers</a></h3>

However, when running the same <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/lxixxP0RMBl">benchmark</a> for strings the results are a bit different:
<pre><code>goos: darwin
goarch: arm64
pkg: github.com/aead/bench
BenchmarkSlicesSort_String-8         858           1404786 ns/op
BenchmarkSort_Strings-8             1040           1155523 ns/op
PASS
ok      github.com/aead/bench   2.764s
</code></pre>

Even though the compiler should be able to (and does) apply the same optimizations, the <code>slices.Sort</code>
function is now slower than <code>sort.Strings</code>. Replacing <code>slices.Sort</code> with <code>slices.SortFunc</code>
and <code>cmp.Compare</code> decreases performance even further:

<pre><code>goos: darwin
goarch: arm64
pkg: github.com/aead/bench
BenchmarkSlicesSortFunc_Compare-8            572           2112564 ns/op
BenchmarkSlicesSort_String-8                 865           1427147 ns/op
BenchmarkSort_Strings-8                     1016           1161378 ns/op
PASS
ok      github.com/aead/bench   4.227s
</code></pre>

<p>
This is quite surprising. How can <code>slices.Sort</code> be faster for <code>[]int</code> and slower
for <code>[]string</code>? It's not specificly optimized for one particular data type. Also, why is
<code>slices.SortFunc</code> using <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/cmp@go1.21.0#Compare"><code>cmp.Compare</code></a>
so much slower than the other two functions?
</p>

<h3 id="3", class="section"><a href="#3">Strings <code>!=</code> NaN</a></h3>
<p>
When comparing two instances of a type (x and y), <code>Compare</code> returns, as one might expect,
-1 if <code>x &lt; y</code>, 0 if <code>x == y</code> and +1 if <code>x &gt; y</code>. However, there is
one special case: What if x and/or y are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN">NaN</a> floating
point numbers?
</p>

<pre><code>// For floating-point types, a NaN is considered less than any non-NaN,
// a NaN is considered equal to a NaN, and -0.0 is equal to 0.0.
</code></pre>

<p>
Therefore, <code>Compare</code> first checks whether x is a NaN by evaluating <code>x != x</code>.
The idea is that, according to the IEEE 754 specification, <code>NaN</code> is not equal to any value -
including another <code>NaN</code>. Hence, <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.21.0:src/cmp/cmp.go;l=40-52"><code>Compare</code></a>
looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code>func Compare[T Ordered](x, y T) int {
	xNaN := x != x
	yNaN := y != y
	if xNaN && yNaN {
		return 0
	}
	if xNaN || x < y {
		return -1
	}
	if yNaN || x > y {
		return +1
	}
	return 0
}</code></pre>

<p>
But why does all of this matter when comparing strings?
</p>

<h3 id="4", class="section"><a href="#4">Things Being Equal</a></h3>
<p>
To generate the machine code for a <code>Compare</code> call, the Go compiler has to determine the
type of x and y. For example, when x and y are integers, the compiler emits a single <code>CMPQ</code>
instruction (on amd64) for the check <code>xNaN || x &lt; y</code>. The compiler is smart enough to
notice that <code>x != x</code> is always false for any value of type <code>int</code> and eliminates
the <code>xNaN</code> variable entirly.
</p>

<p>
When x and y are strings, the compiler inserts a call to <code>runtime.cmpstring</code>. Comparing two
strings has linar (O(N)) runtime complexity. Therefore comparing strings is usually slower than comparing
integers. However, the main difference is that the compiler does not recognize that <code>x != x</code>
is always false for strings. It does not apply the optimisation from above. Hence, it also inserts a call
to <code>runtime.memequal</code> and does not eliminate the <code>xNaN</code> variable. This results in
calling <code>runtime.memequal</code> twice and <code>runtime.cmpstring</code> either once or twice while
an optimal implementation would compare both strings exactly once. This extra calls add up. Especially
when comparing strings that share a common prefix, like long filesystem paths.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, this is a limitation of the Go compiler. While the compiler could recognize that
<code>x != x</code> is always false and eliminate the comparison, regardless whether <code>x</code> is
of type int or string, it applies this optimization just for integers. This is unfortunate because the
documentation guides developers to use <code>slices.Sort</code> which may be faster or slower depending
on the type of your slice. 
</p>


<h3 id="5", class="section"><a href="#5">Update</a></h3>

<p>
In Go 1.22, this issue has been resolved - at least to some extend. In particular, <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/503795">CL 503795</a>
has been merged. It adds a dead code elimination optimization to the compiler. The Go 1.22 compiler is now able
to detect that statements like <code>x != x</code> are always false if <code>x</code> is a string. Go 1.22 also
changed the <code>sort.Strings</code> and <code>sort.Ints</code> implementation to thin wrappers around <code>slices.Sort</code>.
So most Go programs that sort primitive types, like strings or numbers, will use the <code>slices.Sort</code>
implementation automatically.
</p>

<p>
However, <code>cmp.Compare</code> still compares strings twice whenever <code>x &gt;= y</code>. This will be addressed
in Go 1.23 by <a href="https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/578835">CL 578835</a> which will improve the performance
of functions like <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Compare"><code>strings.Compare</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to these changes, sorting and comparing strings in Go will be even faster than before.
